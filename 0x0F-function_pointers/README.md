# Function Pointers in C

Function pointers are variables that hold the address of a function in memory. They allow you to pass functions as arguments to other functions, or to store functions in arrays or structures.

Here's an example of a function pointer declaration:

<pre> int (*myFunc)(int, int); </pre>
